                </div>
                <div class="t3">
                    <p>The cost of running a website can be broken into 3 main elements: the domain, hosting, and the way to make the website.</p>
                    <p>A domain is the unique web address that visitors can type into the browser to find your website, e.g. www.website.com. A domain name is typically a yearly cost, ranging from around $20/year and up.</p>
                    <p>Website hosting allows your website files to be stored and seen on the internet. This is typically a monthly ongoing cost, usually around $14.99/month and up.</p>
                    <p>The website platform used to create a website is another factor to consider. The cost of making a website may vary depending on whether you choose a DIY approach, or hire a web designer or developer. Hiring a web expert can be a significant expense that generally requires an initial design cost and an ongoing maintenance fee.</p>
                    <p>With Website.com premium plans, everything is included to create your website, including a professional domain name for 1 year, web hosting to host your content, and a website builder with easy tools to create your site, sell products, reach international audiences, and market your online presence. Premium plans range from $3/month (promo price for the first year), which is an extremely cost effective way to own a professional website.</p>
                    <p>With a free Website.com plan, you can get a free website name and get online entirely for free. Keep in mind that Website.com premium plans include a professional domain name registration, more website pages and advanced features to lend more professionalism to your site.</p>
                    <p>Your web content will be stored on our secure servers located in Vancouver, Canada.</p>

                <div class="t7">
                    <p>Yes, every website on the internet needs its own domain name for visitors to be able to find it. A custom domain name can make your website look professional online. It builds your brand, makes your website more memorable, and helps visitors find you online. With Website.com, you can start with a free website name, and all premium Website.com plans include a professional custom domain name for 1 year at no additional charge!</p>
                    <p>Domain names are vital to anyone's online presence, but its value is also often undervalued. Problems can arise when domain names are left to expire or become open for anyone to register under their name, from identity theft and impersonation to extortion and malware injection. This is why Website.com offers domain auto renewal feature to help prevent these problems from appearing. <a href="#">Let us know</a> if you are unsure about whether your domain name is set for auto-renewal.</p>
                    <p>Using your custom domain name in your email address (info@yourdomainname.com) can further build your brand and create a sense of trust throughout your customer communications. Website.com Elite plans and above include professional emails at your domain name and a mailbox to store your emails. You can read your emails anywhere, or even set up emails to be accessed on your phone!</p>
